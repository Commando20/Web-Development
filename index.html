            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello, my names is Carlos Salazar. I am 20 years old and currently attending FAU in pursuit of Bachelor's in Computer Science. With the skillset and knowledge that I will learn throughout my courses at FAU, I hope to have a sturdy foundation in the theory and practice of coding. I strive for becoming a software developer.</p>
